<h3><b>Program:</b> A program is the award you are working towards. It is made up of courses, each attributed a unit value. An award is earned by successfully completing the courses specified under the academic program rules.<br>
<br>
 
<b>Course:</b> A course is a syllabus item offered by the University (similar to a subject that you may have studied at school). You undertake courses to complete your program requirements. Courses are identified by a subject area and catalogue number, for example CHEM 1101 is a level 1 Chemistry course.
Within each course there will be classes that you enrol into, for example lectures, tutorials, seminars or practicals. For an explanation of each type of class, see </h3>
