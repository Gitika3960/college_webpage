Placement is understood as assigning jobs to the selected candidates. Assigning jobs to employ­ees may involve a new job or different job. Thus, placement may include initial assignment of job to new employee, on transfer, promotion or demotion of the present employees. Here place­ment refers to the assignment of jobs to new employees only.<br>

Placement involves assigning a specific job to each one of the selected candidates. How­ever, placement is not as simple as it looks. Instead, it involves striking a fit between the requirements of a job and the qualifications of a candidate.<br>

Pigors and Myers have defined placement as “the determination of the job to which an accepted candidate is to be assigned, and his assignment to that job. It is a matching of what the supervisor has reason to think he can do with the job demands (job requirements), and what he offers in the form of pay rolls, companionship with others, promotional possibilities, etc.”.<br>
